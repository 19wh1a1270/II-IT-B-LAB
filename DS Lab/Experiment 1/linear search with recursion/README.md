# Aim Of The Experiment
Write a program that use recursive functions to perform the linaer search opeation for a key value in a given list of integers
## Description
A linear search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched
### Step-by-step procedure for the experiment
1.Define a function with name linear search which will return 0 if the number of elements in the array is zero, and if not then call the linear search function again with elements 1 less than the number of elements of the array, that will repeat till the key value is found and will return the index

2.Write the main fuction and call the linear search function. If the result is 0, then print that the element is not in the array and if the the element is present in the array then return the index value

### Output Obtained
