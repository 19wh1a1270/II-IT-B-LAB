# Aim Of The Experiment
Write a program that use non-recursive functions to perform the linear searching operations for a key value in a given list of integers
## Description 
A linear search  is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched
### Step by step procedure for the experiment
1.Define a function linear search which will return the index of the given key value if the value is present in the the list and will return -1 if the key value is not present in the list 
2.Write the main function and call the linear search function in the main function
