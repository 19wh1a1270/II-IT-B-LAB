# Aim Of The Experiment
Write a program that use non-recursive functions to perform the linear searching operations for a key value in a given list of integers
## Description 
A linear search  is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched
### Step-by-step procedure for the Output
1.Give the values of the array and take the number of elements in the array as n and t as the target number.

2.write a function with name linear search with a for loop which will crosscheck each value of the array from the starting to the end with the target number.

3.whenever the number matches with the target number the index should return which is the key value.

4.here the given array is {10, 6, 8, 15, 20, 3, 14, 99, 66, 30} and our target number is 66, so our program checks from the first element 10 to the 9th element since 66 is present in the 9th position and thus the index 8 i.e the key value will be returned.The output is : Element 66 is present at the index 8

3.here the given array is {10, 6, 8, 15, 20, 3, 14, 99, 66, 30} and our target number is 0, so our program checks from the first element to the last element since the element 0 is not present in the array, the program will return -1 and the output is : Element is not present in the array.
